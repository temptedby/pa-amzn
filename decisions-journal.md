# Decisions Journal — PA-AMZN (Phone Assured Amazon Automation)

A running log of meaningful decisions, the reasoning behind them, options
considered, and trade-offs accepted. Different from the daily summaries
(`confabulator/daily-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, which capture *what shipped*).
This file is the *why* — more detailed, decision-by-decision.

## Format

Each entry is dated with timestamp `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM PT` and answers seven
questions (inspired by ADRs — Michael Nygard, 2011 — but lighter weight):

- **Context** — what triggered the decision (data point, blocker, signal)
- **Options considered** — alternatives evaluated and why we passed
- **Decision** — what we chose
- **Reasoning** — the load-bearing argument
- **Industry source / best practice** — at least one cited reference. "Industry standard" without a name doesn't count.
- **Trade-offs accepted** — what we explicitly gave up
- **Status / date to revisit** — done, in flight, or "check back when X happens"

### The 6-step research gate (apply BEFORE any meaningful change)

Production code, real-person emails, DB changes, deploys, payments, refactors,
new dependencies — anything hard to reverse — passes this gate first:

1. **Problem** — what's wrong + what success looks like. Quote specifics.
2. **Industry standard** — cite at least one external pattern (OWASP, RFC, official docs, well-known tool).
3. **Codebase / reality** — open files, run commands, cite line numbers. Don't guess.
4. **Options** — 3-5 paths with effort / impact / trade-offs.
5. **Recommendation** — pick one, explain why, say what NOT to do and why.
6. **Open questions, trade-offs accepted, rollback plan.**

Drafts for review are always fine. Real sends to real people require explicit go-ahead.

### 2026-06-06 — Ads API blocked on address mismatch; decouple the bid engine via a manual bulk-file bridge

**Context.** The Amazon Advertising API is the *only* thing gating the rest of PA-AMZN. SP-API has been live since 2026-04-20 (inventory, restock recs, shipments). The Ads API was submitted 2026-04-21 as Direct Advertiser tier with approval expected ~04-24. It never landed — and nothing has shipped to the repo since 2026-04-21 (a ~6-week gap; the last commit is `88b5a6a`). William reports the application was **rejected because "my address didn't match."** The rejection email is in the Gmail inbox (forwarded to himself); reading it to confirm the exact field is a pending task — Gmail MCP needs auth. The momentum bid engine and harvest engine are already built and tested (38/38 passing); they are pure functions waiting on data I/O. `src/lib/amazon/ads-api.ts` was never written.

**Options considered.**
1. **Wait on re-approval, then build the live API path.** Single track. Rejected as the *only* plan: it leaves the core IP idle behind Amazon's gatekeeping for an unknown number of weeks, and the same address mismatch could recur.
2. **Manual bulk-file bridge (no API needed).** Megan downloads a Bulk Operations sheet from the Ads console; the app ingests the CSV, runs the existing `decide()` + harvest engines, and emits a ready-to-upload bulk sheet + a diff email. She re-uploads it. Delivers the bid engine's value today, zero API dependency.
3. **Re-apply at a different access tier.** Deferred until we read the rejection email — may not be necessary if the fix is just an address field.

**Decision.** Run **two tracks in parallel:** (A) fix the address mismatch and re-apply for live API access; (B) build the manual bulk-file bridge so the bid/harvest engines start producing value now, independent of approval. Track B's output (a previewable change-list) is useful even after the API goes live, as an audit/preview mode.

**Reasoning.** The project's actual IP is the momentum engine, not the API plumbing. Coupling delivery to Amazon's approval queue has already cost ~6 weeks. Decoupling via the officially-supported bulk-sheet workflow de-risks the whole project and starts compounding value immediately, while the admin fix proceeds on its own clock.

**Industry source / best practice.** Amazon Ads [Bulk Operations](https://advertising.amazon.com/help) is Amazon's own supported path for programmatic-style bid/keyword management without API access. The "Assign API access to a Login with Amazon application" step ([Amazon docs](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/onboarding/assign-api-access)) is a common silent failure point even post-approval, reinforcing the value of an API-independent path.

**Trade-offs accepted.** Track B requires a manual download/upload by Megan each cycle (not unattended) until the live API is wired. We accept that as a bridge. Identity/address verification for Direct Advertiser tier may require matching the address on the Amazon payee/seller account exactly — exact field TBD pending the rejection email.

**Status / date to revisit.** In flight as of 2026-06-06. Tracking infra (this journal + task list) established today. Design findings logged for tomorrow:
- Both engines are pure functions: `decide(KeywordState, cfg, now)` needs three windows (rolling7d, rolling3d, prior3d); `decideHarvest(SearchTermStats, cfg)` needs one rolling14d window. Schema already has `keywords`, `search_terms` (rolling_14d_*), `hourly_snapshots`, `bid_changes`.
- A single Amazon bulk-ops export is a multi-tab `.xlsx` aggregating *one* date range — it does NOT give daily granularity. So the full momentum (3d-vs-prior-3d) rules can't run from one export. **Proposed v1:** a 7-day export drives the high-value rules that only need one window (kill-switch, dead-keyword, exploration-drop), and a 14-day export drives the full harvest engine. Momentum fine-tuning is layered in later (needs multiple exports or the daily Reporting API). To confirm with William before building.
- Open: confirm which Gmail (`william@besocialscene.com`) holds the forwarded rejection email, and that Amazon console access uses the `hello@phoneassured.com` seller login (separate from Gmail).
